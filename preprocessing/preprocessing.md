# Dataset Preprocessing and Exploration

This directory contains utilities for inspecting, analyzing, and visualizing the YOLOv8 marine debris dataset prior to model training.

The preprocessing step is intended for exploratory analysis only and does not modify the dataset.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The preprocessing module provides tools to:

- Load class definitions from the YOLO `data.yaml` file
- Count object instances per class and dataset split
- Visualize class distribution across training, validation, and test sets
- Display example images with YOLO bounding box annotations

This step is useful for understanding class imbalance, dataset composition, and annotation quality.

## 🧠 Main Component

### `PreProcessorYoloV8`

A utility class designed to work with datasets following the standard YOLOv8 directory structure.

Main functionalities include:

- **Class loading**  
  Reads class names directly from `data.yaml`.

- **Object counting**  
  Counts the number of labeled objects per class for each dataset split (`train`, `valid`, `test`).

- **Class distribution visualization**  
  Generates grouped bar plots showing object counts and relative percentages per split.

- **Qualitative inspection**  
  Displays randomly selected example images per class with bounding boxes drawn from YOLO annotations.

## 📊 Generated Outputs

The preprocessing step produces the following outputs:

- Printed summaries of object counts per class and split:

### Object Count per Class and Dataset Split

| Class            | Train | Validation | Test |
|------------------|-------|------------|------|
| can              | 1551  | 112        | 53   |
| foam             | 1637  | 142        | 66   |
| plastic          | 6313  | 569        | 219  |
| plastic bottle   | 1277  | 260        | 144  |
| unknow           | 3334  | 352        | 148  |
- Bar plots showing class distribution across dataset splits
- Visualization of example images with bounding boxes

Due to repository size considerations, generated figures are not stored directly in this directory.

## ▶️ Usage

To run the preprocessing analysis, first install the project dependencies from the root directory:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the preprocessing script:
```bash
python preprocessing/study_data.py
```
